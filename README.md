# Truss-Structure-Project

  Assume that you work for a company called "MODULAR STRUCTURES EAS230, Inc." where you are required 
  to design and fabricate small-to-medium scale metal structures. The company produces 3 truss structures:
  1. Tower structure  2. Crane or winch structure  3. Bridge or span structure 
  
  Each structure can be fabricated from 3 materials: aluminum, steel and titanium 
  
  The tower structures can be manufactured in 3 different sizes, while the bridge/span structures can 
  be manufactured to span from 2 meters up to 50 meters distance (up to 25 modular units each of which 
  is 2 meters in length) the crane/winch structures are only manufactured in 1 size 
 
  As a design engineer, you are asked by your lead to write a MATLAB program to analyze these structures, 
  compute the fabrication cost and produce an estimate for hypothetical clients interests
